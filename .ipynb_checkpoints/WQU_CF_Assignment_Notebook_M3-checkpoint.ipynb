An Up-And-Out barrier call option is just like a normal call option, except that once the underlying reaches above a certain barrier level at any point in time, it will expire worthless. Otherwise, it expires like a normal call. Hence, it is path-dependent."

We also create 2 new lists, share_path_list and firm_value_list, to keep track of the path for each simulation.

The 12 columns correspond to each month of the simulation for the entire year. To turn this into correlated, we then do a Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix built earlier, multiplied with norm_matrix, to give corr_norm_matrix, which gives a matrix of correlated random variables. The first row of the matrix is the random variables for share price, while the second row is for the firm value. By passing these random variables into the share_path function, we generate the path and save them into the respective lists.\n",
